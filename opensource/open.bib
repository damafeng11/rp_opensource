  abstract = {Informed energy decision making requires effective software, high-quality
	input data, and a suitably trained user community. Developing these
	resources can be expensive and time consuming. Even when data and
	tools are intended for public re-use they often come with technical,
	legal, economic and social barriers that make them difficult to adopt,
	adapt and combine for use in new contexts. We focus on the promise
	of open, publically accessible software and data as well as crowdsourcing
	techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools that can deliver
	crucial, policy-relevant insight, particularly in developing countries,
	where planning resources are highly constrained鈥攁nd the need to
	adapt these resources and methods to the local context is high. We
	survey existing research, which argues that these techniques can
	produce high-quality results, and also explore the potential role
	that linked, open data can play in both supporting the modelling
	process and in enhancing public engagement with energy issues.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses three key economic problems raised by the emergence
	of Open Source: motivation, co-ordination, and diffusion. First,
	the movement took off through the activity of a community that did
	not follow profit motivations. Second, a hierarchical co-ordination
	emerged without proprietary rights. Third, Open Source systems diffused
	in environments dominated by proprietary standards. The paper shows
	that recent developments in the theory of diffusion of technologies
	with network externality may help to explain these phenomena. A simulation
	model based on heterogeneous agents is developed in order to identify
	the relevant factors in the diffusion of the technology.},

  title = {Intelligence in the internet age: The emergence and evolution of
	Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)},
  journal = {Computers in Human Behavior},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {28},
  pages = {673 - 682},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
	as an important component for understanding human problem solving
	in the 21st century. OSINT is in many ways the result of changing
	human鈥搃nformation relationships resulting from the emergence and
	growing dominance of the Internet and the World Wide Web in everyday
	life. This paper suggests that the Internet/Web changes the dynamic
	relationship between what Cattell and Horn have identified as the
	two general factors of human intelligence: crystallized intelligence
	and fluid intelligence. The Internet/Web open up new possibilities
	for accessing information and transcending over-determined cultural
	intelligence in problem solving. This offers fluid intelligence,
	which often trails off in adulthood, a new vitality across the lifespan.
	But the diminishment of crystallized intelligence, and especially
	cultural intelligence, also presents a number of important problems
	in maintenance of cohesive, social cooperatives. The development
	of OSINT (using tools and ethos created by the Open Source movement
	of the last few decades) offers both a framework for reaching beyond
	the boundaries of traditional cultural intelligence and ways to create
	cooperative, open, problem solving communities. The Internet/Web
	will continue to create confusion and fear as we move deeper into
	this new age, but also presents extraordinary possibilities for augmenting
	human intellect if we can understand it and learn to harness its
	potential.},

	perspective},
  journal = {European Management Journal},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {30},
  pages = {352 - 371},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {Summary This paper uses a large data set of Free Open Source Software
	(FOSS) projects obtained from SourceForge.net to investigate survival
	factors at various stages of a FOSS project鈥檚 lifecycle. It distinguishes
	FOSS projects that are still at the initial stage of development
	from those at the growth stage, and posits that the relative importance
	of the identified survival factors changes as FOSS projects evolve
	from one stage to the next. The results demonstrate the changing
	effect of factors over time affecting FOSS survival. Restrictive
	FOSS licenses and large internal and external networks are found
	to present advantages for projects that are at the initial stage,
	but the advantages dissipate as the projects move into the growth
	stage. Projects with high-quality external networks, greater levels
	of user/developer participation and service quality, and projects
	targeted at technical users have a higher likelihood of surviving
	at both stages. These findings show that a FOSS project team needs
	to be aware of the conditioning effect of time and focus on the appropriate
	mix of survival factors as the project moves from one stage to the
	next.},

abstract ={Open‐source software development is a production model that exploits the distributed intelligence of participants in Internet communities. This model is efficient because of two related reasons: it avoids the inefficiencies of a strong intellectual property regime and it implements concurrently design and testing of software modules. The hazard of open source is that projects can ‘fork’ into competing versions. However, open‐source communities consist of governance structures that constitutionally minimize this danger. Because open source works in a distributed environment, it presents an opportunity for developing countries to participate in frontier innovation.},
